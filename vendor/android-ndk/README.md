This folder contains Android NDK emulator that does nothing. 
Purpose is to prevent Gradle build errors (thus indexing errors) 
when Android NDK is not found. These scripts only used in the Docker mode, 
if you are using `java-language-processor` locally, we suggest to install and configure 
real Android NDK.
